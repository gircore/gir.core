# Welcome to Gir.Core

[![Continuous integration status](https://github.com/GirCore/gir.core/workflows/Continuous%20integration/badge.svg?branch=develop)](https://github.com/gircore/gir.core/actions)
[![Website depolyment status](https://github.com/GirCore/gircore.github.io/workflows/Deploy%20website/badge.svg?branch=develop)](https://github.com/gircore/gircore.github.io/actions)

Gir.Core is a C# wrapper for [GObject]-based libraries like [GTK] for user interfaces.

This project aims to provide a complete set of APIs for writing rich cross-platform user interfaces and multimedia programs. It is built upon the well-established [GObject Introspection][gi] framework for language bindings.

### Features
* **Idiomatic C#:** An API which feels natural to C# developers (including the async/await feature).
* **Simplicity:** Memory management is handled automatically, greatly simplifying the C-API.
* **Complete API:** Support for the entire GTK and GStreamer stack, enabling feature-rich applications which deeply integrate with the OS.
* **Declarative UI:** A declarative syntax for creating GTK UIs (See the [DeclarativeUI Sample][sample_gtk_declarative]). User interfaces may also be created the traditional way and/or with [GtkBuilder XML][GtkBuilder].
* **Extensibility:** Allows 3rd party developers to write bindings for other GObject-based libraries, achieving full interoperability between them.

## Status
We are currently in a period of heavy iteration over the core internals of the project. The code is under heavy development and not ready for production. There is currently _no_ nuget package available.

## Get Involved
Anyone who wants to help is very welcome. If you want to start working on the project, take a look at our [Good First Issues](https://github.com/gircore/gir.core/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) or get in touch by starting a [Discussion](https://github.com/gircore/gir.core/discussions).

### Matrix Room
We have a matrix room for discussing gir.core. Please join if you'd like to help (or just want to chat!)

## Generate & Use
To generate the bindings locally follow these steps. Make sure to initialise submodules with `--recursive` otherwise the `gir-files` directory will not be loaded properly.

```sh
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/gircore/gir.core.git
$ cd gir.core/src
$ dotnet fsi GenerateLibs.fsx
```
If you want to build using Windows please see the accompanying [documentation](docs/windows.md).

### Examples

If you want to clean the [Libs folder](src/Libs) of all generated files run:

    $ dotnet fsi CleanLibs.fsx

To use the newly generated libraries in your project just add a reference to the csproj file of the project you want to use, e.g:

    $ dotnet add reference [RepoPath]/Libs/Gtk/Gtk.csproj

## Code structure
The folder structure in this repository is organized as follows:
* **[src/GirTool](src/GirTool):** The tool to generate the bindings.
* **[src/Generation/GirLoader](src/Generation/GirLoader):** A library for reading and resolving GObject Introspection repositories.
* **[src/Generation/Generator3](src/Generation/Generator3):** Code generator generates C# code from GObject Introspection data.
* **[src/Integration](src/Integration):** Optional source generators to reduce boilerplate code in your projects.
* **[src/Libs](src/Libs):** Contains manually written code for libraries. The generator outputs code here.
* **[src/Samples](src/Samples):** Example programs using GTK, GStreamer, and others.
* **[src/Tests](src/Tests):** Unit and Integration tests.
* **[ext/gir-files](https://github.com/gircore/gir-files):** Introspection data from [gircore/gir-files](https://github.com/gircore/gir-files).

The code in the library folder is not complete because most of the code is generated when the [GirTool](src/GirTool) is run.
