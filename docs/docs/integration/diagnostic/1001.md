- Title: GObject subclass constructor with parameters must call 'this()' constructor
- Message: GObject subclass constructor with parameters must call a generated constructor like 'this()'

Not calling the `this` results in the class being represented by its parent type instead of its actual type. Call `this()` to ensure the correct type of the instance.

Invalid code:
```csharp
[Subclass<Gtk.Widget>]
public partial class MyWidget
{
    public MyWidget(string data)
    {
        ...
    }
}
```

Solution:
```csharp
[Subclass<Gtk.Widget>]
public partial class MyWidget
{
    public MyWidget(string data) : this()
    {
        ...
    }
}
```
