- Title: GObject subclass constructor must not call base constructor
- Message: GObject subclass constructor must call a generated constructor like 'this()' instead of 'base()'

An explicit call to the constructor of a base class results in an instance which has the type of its parent instead of its own type. Call `this()` to ensure the correct type of the instance.

Invalid code:
```csharp
[Subclass<Gtk.Widget>]
public partial class MyWidget
{
    public MyWidget(string text) : base()
    {
        ...
    }
}
```

Solution:
```csharp
[Subclass<Gtk.Widget>]
public partial class MyWidget
{
    public MyWidget(string text) : this()
    {
        ...
    }
}
```
