- Title: GObject subclass constructor with parameters must be replaced with a factory method.
- Message: GObject does not use constructors to create instances. A subclass must support creation through the `NewWithProperties` method which may not provide any parameters: If you use custom factory methods, the code must be written in a way that supports parameterless creation of an instance. Implement a custom factory method to supply any optional members.

Invalid code:
```csharp
[GObject.Subclass<GObject.Object>]
public partial class MyObject
{
    private string data;

    public MyObject(string data)
    {
        this.data = data;
        ...
    }
}
```

Solution:
```csharp
[GObject.Subclass<GObject.Object>]
public partial class MyObject
{
    private string? data;
 
    public static MyObject NewWithString(string data)
    {
        var obj = NewWithProperties([]);
        obj.data = data;

        return obj;
    }
}
```
